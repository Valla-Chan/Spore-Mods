### <p align="center">All mods on this page require Spore: Galactic Adventures</p>
#### The most recent mod versions can be downloaded in the "Releases" section to the right of this page.

Below are mod downloads that are hosted on their own mod repos:
- [Creature Part Unlock API](https://github.com/Valla-Chan/Valla_Spore_CreaturePartUnlockAPI)
- [UI Fixer Framework](https://github.com/Valla-Chan/Valla_SporeUIFixerFramework)

#### Download info:
- Both the raw `.package` file and the full `.sporemod` files are included with some older downloads; most of these are interchangeable and you can download just one or the other.

- If a download offers a file called `Mod.zip`, this is simply a package inside of a zipped folder, designed to prevent Github's removal of the `!` prefix on files.
To install a `Mod.zip` download, simply extract the folder and install the package file normally.
